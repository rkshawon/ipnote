*Library: A collection of pre-written functions and routines that can be reused
 in software development to perform specific tasks.

*Package: A bundle of code, data, and resources, often used for organizing and 
distributing software components.

*Framework: A structured environment that provides a foundation for building
 applications, including pre-defined components and rules.

*Runtime Environment: The environment in which a software program executes, 
including the hardware and system software necessary to run the application.

*Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task in a finite number of steps.

*Data Structure: A way of organizing and storing data to efficiently perform 
operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion.

*Version Control: A system for tracking and managing changes to source code,
 allowing collaboration and maintaining code history.

*Database Management System (DBMS): Software for managing, storing, and retrieving data from a database.

*Testing: The process of evaluating a software application to identify and fix 
defects or issues before its deployed.

*Bug: An error, flaw, or defect in a software program that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly.

*Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing errors or issues in software code.

*Agile Development: A software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, 
collaboration, and iterative development.

*Scrum: A specific Agile methodology that organizes work into time-bound, collaborative sprints.

*User Interface (UI): The point of interaction between a user and a software application,
including screens, buttons, and visual elements.

*User Experience (UX): The overall experience and satisfaction a user has while 
interacting with a software application.

*Open Source: Software with a license that allows the source code to be freely viewed, modified, and distributed.

*Compiler: A tool that translates high-level programming code into machine code that can be executed by a computer.

*API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allows different software
applications to communicate and interact with each other.

*Dependency Injection: A design pattern that involves supplying dependencies to a component from the
outside, making it more modular and testable.

*Frontend: The part of a software application that the user interacts with directly, typically
 through a web browser or user interface.

*Backend: The part of a software application that handles data processing, server-side logic, and database interactions.

*DevOps: A set of practices that combine development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to automate and
streamline the software delivery process.

*Containerization: The practice of packaging an application and its dependencies into a single container,
ensuring consistency across different environments.

*Refactoring: The process of improving code quality and maintainability without changing its external behavior.

*Code Review: The examination of code by other developers to identify issues and ensure code quality and standards are met.

*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that organizes code into objects,
which encapsulate data and behavior, promoting reusability and modularity.

*Functional Programming: A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical
functions and avoids changing state and mutable data, emphasizing immutability and pure functions.
