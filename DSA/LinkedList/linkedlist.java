int* find middle of linked list
->use two pointer node1 and node2 and traverse to link node1 should jump two time and node should jump one time.
after loop node2 should be in the middle. (while looping with node1 before second jump check if next is null or not ).

int* Delete Node in a Linked List without referring the head.
-> just get the value of next node and point the current node to next of next node which will ignone next node.
->actually insteading removing the current node remove next node and store next nodes value to current node.


int* Intersection of Two Linked Lists
-> The main purpose is to start from equal points and changing head does that.
