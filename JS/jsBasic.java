const JavaScript?
*JavaScript is a programming language that is used for web development.
it is a high-level, dynamically-typed scripting language that
enables web developers to create interactive and dynamic content on websites.

*JavaScript is known for its flexibility, as it can be used for a wide range of tasks beyond web development,
including server-side scripting (Node.js), desktop application development, and even
IoT (Internet of Things) programming. It plays a crucial role in modern web development,
making web pages more engaging and user-friendly.

*Fact, var a = b = 3;
is actually shorthand for:
b = 3;
var a = b;


const Compiler vs Interpreter?
    *Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs.
    *Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.
    *Just-in-time compilation (JIT): In JIT the intermediate representation is compiled to native machine code at runtime.

*The first JavaScript engines were simple interpreters, but all modern engines use just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance reasons.

*A compiler takes in the entire program and requires a lot of time to analyze the source code. Whereas the interpreter takes a single line of code and very little time to analyze it.
*Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.
*A compiler displays all errors after compilation. If your code has mistakes, it will not compile. But the interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.
*Interpretation does not replace compilation completely.
*Compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons like faster performance and smaller memory footprint.

*In the case of an interpreter, it directly converts the source code into machine code or bytecode as it executes the code line by line or statement by statement.
This process is typically done in real-time, without producing a separate compiled executable.

Dynamic Compilation: Instead of compiling the entire program ahead of time,
JIT compiler translates the program into machine code on-the-fly, just before execution. This dynamic compilation happens at runtime.
