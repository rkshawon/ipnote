What is Scope?
In JavaScript, scope refers to the context in which variables and functions are declared and accessed.
it determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions throughout your code.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their 
containing scope during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are declared in the code. This 
means that variables and functions can be used before they are actually declared in the code.
What is Error handling?
Error handling is the process of managing errors
What is Asynchronous Programming?
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently,
without blocking the execution of the code.
In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is commonly achieved through mechanisms such as callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
Asynchronous programming is used to handle multiple concurrent tasks efficiently, such as fetching data from servers, handling user interactions,
and updating the UI dynamically.
