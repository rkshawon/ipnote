  <ul>
    Abstraction: Process of picking the essence of an object you really need In
    other words, pick the properties you need from the object Example:

    <li>
      a. Mobile - Button/Touch screen, power button, volume button, sim port.
    </li>
    <li>b. Human - Voice, Body, Eye Sight, Hearing, Emotions.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    Encapsulation: Process of hiding the details of an object you don't need In
    other words, hide the properties and operations you don't need from the
    object but are required for the object to work properly Example:
    <li>
      a. Mobile - How the input is parsed and processed, How pressing a button
      on/off or changes volumes, how sim will connect to service providers.
    </li>
    <li>
      b. Human - How voice is produced, What's inside the body, How eye sight
      works, How hearing works, How emotions generate and effect us. ABSTRACT
      everything you need and ENCAPSULATE everything you don't need
