  <q>shallow vs deep copy?</q>
  <a>
    Shallow copy creates a new object that stores the reference of the original
    elements. Instead of making a duplicate of the nested objects, it just
    replicates their references.</a

  <a>
    A deep copy creates a new object that stores copies of the original
    elements. It is not shared between the original and the copy. Deep copy
    actually clones the underlying data.</a
