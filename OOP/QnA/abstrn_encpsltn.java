    other words, hide the properties and operations you don't need from the
    object but are required for the object to work properly Example:

      on/off or changes volumes, how sim will connect to service providers.

      b. Human - How voice is produced, What's inside the body, How eye sight
      works, How hearing works, How emotions generate and effect us. ABSTRACT
