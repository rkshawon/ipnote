**Layer 1: Physical Layer**
- Transmits raw binary data over a physical medium.
- Encodes data into electrical, optical, or radio signals.
- Manages physical connections, cables, and hardware.
- Devices: Hub, network cables (e.g., Ethernet cables), repeaters.

**Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
- Frames data into packets.
- Assigns MAC addresses for device identification.
- Manages access to the physical medium (e.g., Ethernet collision avoidance).
- Devices: Switch, network bridge, network interface cards (NICs).

**Layer 3: Network Layer**
- Routes data between different networks.
- Uses logical addressing (IP addresses) to identify devices.
- Determines the best path for data transmission.
- Devices: Router, Layer 3 switch.

**Layer 4: Transport Layer**
- Ensures end-to-end communication between devices.
- Segments and reassembles data from upper layers.
- Provides error detection, flow control, and data sequencing.
- No specific devices at this layer; it's primarily a software function within the operating system.

**Layer 5: Session Layer**
- Manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions.
- Coordinates dialog between applications on different devices.
- Handles synchronization and error recovery in data exchanges.
- No specific devices at this layer; it's primarily a software function within the operating system.

**Layer 6: Presentation Layer**
- Translates, encrypts, and compresses data as needed.
- Handles data format and character code conversions.
- Ensures data compatibility between heterogeneous systems.
- No specific devices at this layer; it's primarily a software function within the operating system.

**Layer 7: Application Layer**
- Provides user interfaces and network services.
- Hosts applications and network services like web browsers and email clients.
- Initiates and terminates communication between software applications.
- Devices: Computers, servers, application-specific hardware.
