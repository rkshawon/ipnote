UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are both transport layer
protocols in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, but they serve different purposes and have distinct
characteristics. Heres a comparison of UDP and TCP:

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
- **Connection-Oriented:** TCP establishes a connection between two devices (a sender and a receiver) before data transfer begins.
This connection includes a three-way handshake to ensure both sides are ready to communicate.
- **Reliable:** TCP provides reliable data delivery. It guarantees that data will be delivered in order and without errors.
If data is lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP automatically retransmits it.
- **Ordered:** Data sent over a TCP connection is received in the same order it was sent. 
TCP ensures that data is properly sequenced.
- **Flow Control:** TCP uses flow control mechanisms to prevent data overload and ensure that
data is sent at a rate the receiver can handle.
- **Connection State:** TCP maintains connection state information, which involves additional
overhead but enables robust error handling and management.
- **Examples:** TCP is used for applications where data integrity and sequencing are crucial,
such as web browsing, email, file transfers, and most common internet services.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
- **Connectionless:** UDP does not establish a connection before data transfer.
It simply sends data without a preliminary handshake.
- **Unreliable:** UDP does not guarantee reliable data delivery.
Theres no automatic error detection or correction, and data can be lost or arrive out of order.
- Unordered: Data sent over a UDP connection may not be received in the same order it was sent.
- **No Flow Control:** UDP lacks flow control mechanisms, which means it can send data without regard
for the receivers capacity.
- **Minimal Overhead:** UDP has minimal overhead, making it faster and more efficient for some applications.
- **Examples:** UDP is used for applications where real-time or low-latency data transmission is more important
than data reliability, such as online gaming, VoIP, streaming media, and DNS (Domain Name System) lookups.

The choice between UDP and TCP depends on the specific requirements of the application.
If data reliability, order, and error correction are critical, TCP is the preferred choice.
On the other hand, if low latency, speed, and real-time communication are more important,
UDP may be the better option.
