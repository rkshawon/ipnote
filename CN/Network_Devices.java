const Host?
Host is any device that send and recieve traffic. Anything that send and recieve traffic over network.
Example computet laptop phone  server printer cloud server 

Client vs server : Client send request and server send response.relative to specific communication.

Server is a computer with software installed which response to specific request


const IP address?
IP address stands for internet protocol address.
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or
network that connects to the internet.
IPv4 is 32 bits. IPv6 is 64 bits

const Computer Network?
A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information.
Anytime two device is conncected, there establish network.


const Repeater?
A repeater is a networking device used to extend the reach or range of a network by amplifying and
retransmitting data signals.
It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model, primarily working with electrical or optical signals,
and its main purpose is to regenerate and boost these signals so that they can travel over longer distances
without signal degradation

const Hub ?
A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network.
A hub has many ports in it. A computer which intends to be connected to the network is plugged in to one of these ports.
When a data frame arrives at a port, it is broadcast to every other port,
without considering whether it is destined for a particular destination or not.


const Bridge?
A bridge in computer networking is a device that connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments,
operating at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to intelligently forward data
packets based on their MAC addresses, thereby reducing network collisions and improving network efficiency by
creating separate collision domains. Bridges are used for segmenting and enhancing the performance of networks.

const Switch?
In computer networking, a switch is a network device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2)
of the OSI model.It is designed to connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and
intelligently manage the traffic flow.

const Routers? 
A router in computer networking is a device that connects multiple computer networks together and
directs data traffic between them.Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model
and are essential for forwarding data packets between different networks
* Routers learn which network they are attach to known as Routes, stored in a routing table.
Routing table stores all network which are connected.
Default Gateway is a Router.


const APRS ?
ARP allows devices to find each others physical addresses within the same network. 

const subnet mask?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit address that is used in IP (Internet Protocol) networking to divide an
IP address into network and host portions. It is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs
to the network and which part belongs to the host.
